summary: We ask participants to provide us with feedback after the workshop.

In this short method, we prepare participants to provide us with feedback about the workshop methods and facilitation style. We have found that online surveys work well for collecting feedback, but that it is important to share why we think that participant feedback is valuable. We have asked for feedback to help us improve future methods, become better facilitators, and reflect on key ideas from the day.

Making clear that we will use the feedback to drive the collaboration forward can engender _trust_ and _collegiality_ with participants and facilitators.
