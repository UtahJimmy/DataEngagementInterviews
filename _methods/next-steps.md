Wrap up the ideas discussed and confirm with the group, what will happen next with the artefacts and ideas, what will be the next steps of the collaboration and what is expected of them both initially (e.g. please fill in the feedback survey in the next couple of days) and longer term (e.g. we hope you will be available for a feedback session in a few months time).
