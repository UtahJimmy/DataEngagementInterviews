summary: An adaption of the Analogy Introduction method for introducing, with a graphical twist to get participants thinking visually.
---
All participants are asked in advance to use a _single indicative graphic_ to describe themselves and the _current situation_ that we are dealing with. This is a spin on the analogy introduction question - _"if you were to describe yourself as an animal, what would you be?"_ : _"if you were to describe yourself with a graphic, what would you be? (and c an you show us?)"_

\\
This is an informative individual exercise, but the sharing and levelling is intended to promote _collegiality_. That participants are given a short and relatively open brief gives them some _agency_ at the outset of the meeting.

\\
Graphical introductions are straightforward to set up - a short reminder in advance of the meeting suffices. Participants are asked to talk individually to a graphical prompt that describes them and their current situation in light of the workshop theme. Digital graphics can be delivered in advance, but having participants draw on a whiteboard or flip chart also works well.

\\
Leading by example and emphasizing that these are ‘fast forward’ style presentations helps lower the _challenge_ and to get introductions completed with expediency. In terms of _topic_ the emphases on graphics and the theme are intended to reveal some information about approaches to visualization and knowledge of it.

There are plenty of opportunities for creative spins on this approach given the particular context, environment and group dynamic. Another option is to ask participants to _"Draw a bar chart, pie chart or scatter plot that describes the way you are feeling?"_
