This method reframes constraints as opportunities to spur creative thinking. First, participants identify constraints (i.e., barriers) of the envisioned visualization tools. Next, they select the most pressing constraint and imagine that it has been removed. Then, they create ideas about what would be possible without that constraint in the way.

\\
We have used this method in 4 of our workshops [P2, P4, P5, P8]. In our experience, identifying constraints is low _challenge_ and helps to build _interest_ because participants typically have ideas about why problems in their domain are hard. Asking participants to remove constraints increases the _challenge_. Because this method is performed in small groups, it can foster _collegiality_.

\\
If this method is preceded by Wishful Thinking, then the know/see/do prompts can be used after barriers are removed.

#### Materials
at least 2 colors of post-it notes to record the barriers and opportunities
\\
if preceded by Wishful Thinking, then 1 color post-it notes for barriers + 3 colors for know/see/do prompts
