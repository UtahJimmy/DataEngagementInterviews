outputs: (visually) annotated agenda giving feedback on the day's activities
summary: Annotating an agenda of the day elicits feedback.

Asking participants to reflect on what has been achieved is intended to be motivating and have a positive effect on _agency_. But feedback needs to be as smooth as possible, with little _challenge_ that can threaten participation (particularly after a long day).

\\
A visualization theme can be used here by providing an overview of the plan and leaving space for participants to complete bars alongside each activity in which they rate their experience according to particular criteria --- e.g., the levels of creativity experienced, the degree to which the activity was enjoyable or useful, or perhaps even the TACTICs used to execute the workshop.
The result is an _agenda bar chart_. Stickers could also be used in place of drawing on the agenda.

\\
Asking participants to sketch the levels of divergence / convergence experienced on the agenda could help them reflect on what had been done and establish a sense of achievement.

#### Materials

<!--- I actually really like the idea of a structured agenda that people can draw and stick feedback on! --->
