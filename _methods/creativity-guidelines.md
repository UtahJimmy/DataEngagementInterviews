To lay a foundation for a creative atmosphere, we introduce guidelines for the workshop. These guidelines can reinforce the need for _collegiality_ and _trust_ in a successful workshop. Example guidelines include:
- All ideas are valid --- record them!
- Speak in headlines and follow up with details
- Beware that facilitators may guide the conversation to stay on topic
- Switch off all electronic devices

Although this method is primarily passive, consider ways to encourage _agency_ and _interest_. For example, it could be modified by having participants create their own guidelines for creative participation.
