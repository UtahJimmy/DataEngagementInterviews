summary: A catchall method to explore possibilities through freewheeling ideation.
---
This is the catchall method used in CVO workshops. It was first described by Osborn as _"using the brain to storm a creative problem - and to do so in a commando fashion, with each stormer audaciously attacking the same objective."_

\\
Although Osborn described unconstrained and unstructured ideation, we use a four step process to maintain focus on the _topic_ that helps to preserve _interest_. First, we prompt participants with a topic. Next, we ask them to generate as many ideas as possible about it (often individually). Then, we may continue generating ideas in small groups. After that, we discuss the ideas and potentially ask participants to rank or sort them.

\\
The prompt of this method can influence the _challenge_ of generating ideas. We have used prompts that ask participants to identify: the current problems and successes of existing tools [P1]; the aspirations for envisioned visualization solutions [P1]; the good/bad aspects of current workflow [P3]; and the desired tasks and functionality of visualization solutions [P1]. The possibilities for prompts are practically infinite.
