This method is typically combined with a break for lunch. In this method, we ask participants to find a physical artifact from outside of the workshop that relates to the _topic_. Upon returning to the workshop, we describe and discuss the artifacts and ideas in a group.

\\
The motivation for this method is as described by Goodwin et al. _"The idea is that participants remove themselves from a task, take a mental or physical journey to seek images or stimuli and then bring these back to make connections with the task."_ Discussions about the resulting artifacts can expand the ideaspace in surprising ways.
