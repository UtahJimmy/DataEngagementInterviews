Data visualization is all about discovery from data and many of our workshops have been sequenced to give us the time and knowledge to build visualization prototypes through which we can explore participants' data sets interactively and collectively.

_Brainstorming_ around interactive representations of their own data enables workshop participants to be creative in terms of the domain (direct insights from data), functionality (discovering / developing requirements), focus (identifying and prioritising problems to which VIS can be applied). It focuses creative activity directy on the _topic_ in hand.
It can also help VIS researchers develop ideas about their domain through VIS insights - experiences and reactions that tell us something about the way visualization might work in applied contexts.

Various approaches exist for using data to stimulate idea generation but in our experience _Data Chauffeurring_ with prototype applications works well.
As we are not testing interface or interaction (and as software may not be robust or stable), developers can control their prototypes in line with direct requests from data owners using verbal instructions to direct a visualization expert chauffer.
Wall sized projection is effective, but large shared screens may be adequate.
Giving data owners increasing in more stable software prototypes can be effective in terms of _agency_.

Recording insights can be difficult in a collective chaufferring exercise with multiple participants offering suggestions as exploration occurs. Concurrent screen and audio capture are most effective here. Structured activities that enable participants to identify, prioritise and document discoveries post _datastorm_ are encouraged.

High levels of _interest_, _agency_ and _collegiality_ are usually evident in these sessions that build confidence in the project and mutual _trust_.

In some cases time spent wrangling data has detracted from creativity workshops (e.g. DiscoveryJam) and this is a risk that can effect _interest_, _trust_ and energy levels.

But developing technologies for rapidly visualizing structured data sets, such as the _Tableau_ software products, and delarative visualization languages that allow graphics to be specified and modified rapidly, such as _vega-lite_, provide many opportunities for _datastorming_ during initial requirements workshops. Data preparation and sharing in advance of the workshop is likely to make this more achievable.
