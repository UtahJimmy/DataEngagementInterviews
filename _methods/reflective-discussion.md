This method is a semi-structured discussion to gain some initial feedback on how well the workshop went and the feelings of the group for the ideas produced during the day.

We have used prompt questions to encourage discussion such as "What has surprised you most today?", "What do you know now that you did not know this morning?" or "What will you do differently tomorrow?"
