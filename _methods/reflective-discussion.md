A semi-structured discussion to gain some initial feedback on how well the workshop went and the feelings of the group for the ideas produced during the day. We use prompt questions to encourage discussion such as "What has surprised you most today?", "What do you know now that you did not know this morning?" or "What will you do differently tomorrow?"

Further thinking about the answers to reflective discussions can help researchers to better understand what aspects of the workshop were particularly valuable. This can be helpful while analyzing the workshop results and planning future workshops.
