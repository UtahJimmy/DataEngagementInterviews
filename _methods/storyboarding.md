This convergent method provides information for researchers about which ideas the participants consider more important or potentially useful. First, participants are tasked with drawing a story that synthesizes ideas from the day into a coherent narrative. Next, the storyboards are discussed and additional ideas are recorded.

\\
We have some evidence that the activity is polarizing. The _challenge_ involved in creating a story is likely to be very being personal and so efforts to ensure that all participants are either comfortable with and engaged in the challenge or excused and participating in alternative activity are important. Hence, this method could be used in tandem with other convergent and active methods, such as mind-mapping or brainstorming.
