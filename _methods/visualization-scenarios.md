title:  Visualization Scenarios
duration: 45 - 60 min
phase: core
ideaspace: convergent
activity: active
materials: paper and pens, perhaps provide storyboard outline on printed sheets. Flipchart is an alternative through which sketches can be sequenced.
summary: Creating graphical summaries of scenarios for visualization analysis can help develop what tasks need to be supported.

In this method, we participants to imagine or select either a scenario or user story and then develop sketches of a visualization solution that would be supportive of the kinds of tasks envisioned.

\\
This method enables participants to establish process flow and suggest design candidates in a broad sense. Scenarios can be selected from a prepared list or preferably from examples developed in a preceding workshop method.

While this visual twist on more general _Storyboarding_ activities has proved successful in some of our projects, this has not always been the case in our experience. Setting this as an individual task gives people _agency_, but working in groups may be more effective as sketching is likely to be seen as more of a _challenge_ to some than others who are more willing to take it on.

\\
We ran this as a group activity in the human terrain project with each addressing different scenarios [P3]. A domain specialist led each group and presented sketches of visual solutions to others at the workshop, including designers & developers.
