summary: Create mind-maps to link concepts raised during the workshop.
---
Mind maps are sketched networks of related concepts ---  visual representations that structure ideas. Creating mind maps can provide means through which participants can connect and contextualize ideas. Participants in our creativity workshops have used these to identify required features and to record and prompt analogy in _visualization analogies_.

\\
This activity may come naturally to some participants but is likely to be more of a _challenge_ to others and so it is worth considering as an optional means of recording ideas or as a group activity with a designated _visual lead_ who coordinates the drawing.  These options may help us manage _challenge_ and vary levels of _collegiality_ associated with this activity.

#### Materials
paper, pens, visualization examples, scissors, glue, tape
