Just as the _"Buy a feature"_ method asks participants to prioritize by limiting resources, _Draw A Feature_ achieves something similar with a visual twist, by providing limited space and time in which workshop participants must sketch a key aspect of the visualization solution that could to be developed.

Drawing on large scale is effective, with the suggestion that one pen color be used for annotation that depicts interaction. The drawings could be used as a basis for discussion, with participants touring sketches displayed on the walls as sketch owners describe the features. They could be combined into system descriptions or used in an hierarchical ranking process.
