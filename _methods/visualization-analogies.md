We present a curated collection of visualizations and ask participants to individually record analogies to their domain and to specify aspects of the visualizations that they like or dislike.

\\
More specifically, first, we provide participants with paper handouts that contain a representative image of each visualization. Next, we present the curated visualizations on a projector and ask participants to think independently about how each visualization could apply to their domain and to record their ideas. Then, we discuss these visualizations and analogies in a large group.

\\
The initial exercise gives participants time and space to act individually. Subsequent group discussions on these visualizations prompts additional _collegiality_, particularly if structured to ensure that all participate. Enabling participants to evaluate visualization possibilities and relate the to their problem domain is intended to engender _agency_. While problem specific data are unlikely to be used, the combination of domain problem and visualization solution makes _visualization analogies_ an activity that addresses the _topics_ of the workshop directly.

\\
Although this method is primarily passive, participants report that it is engaging and inspiring to see the broad possibilities of visualization and relate visualization solutions to their problems.
