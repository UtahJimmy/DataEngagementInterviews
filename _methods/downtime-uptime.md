Organizers are often loathe to schedule downtime, preferring a packed schedule. But creative thinking relies on downtime. Downtime can result in divergence (creative ideas) or convergence (ranking), or interpersonal relationships been developed, all of which are useful. However, our experience of food breaks has been different across workshops. In some cases, the environment has not been conducive to communication as there have been few external stimuli, or there has been noise, or the mechanics of ordering have interrupted opportunities to think and communicate.

We recommend asking participants, perhaps through a specific exercise if time and the physical environment allows, to think about what they have learned and perhaps how this relates to their perspective on the project. Asking people to chat with somebody they do not know or have not met can be productive and spark _interest_ here, but may be a _challenge_ to some. But it does give scope for information exchange, interpersonal relationships and _trust_ to develop, and can help establish _collegiality_.

_Topic_ relevance can be achieved by priming participants to contribute something to the communication about their domain that other participants do not know, or with physical prompts for discussion - visualization examples or summaries of domain work. But serendipitous conversations can break out and be highly effective.

In one of our workshops a WiFi connection problem caused us to halt formal workshop proceedings [P2]. One participant set up a connection through their phone and the organizers' reliance on them had significant effects on _trust_ and _agency_. Other participants discussed the workshop and workshop themes while this was going on - probably with positive effect.
Scheduled downtime works well, but this could easily be faked with some kind of imaginary problem ("_can you just chat amongst yourselves while I fix the WiFi_").
