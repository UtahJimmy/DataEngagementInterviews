Organizers are often loathe to schedule downtime, preferring a packed schedule. But creative thinking relies on downtime. Downtime can result in divergence (creative ideas) or convergence (ranking). It can also help establish interpersonal relationships. We typically provide downtime between each method.

We recommend asking participants, perhaps through a specific exercise if time and the physical environment allows, to think about what they have learned and how this relates to their perspective on the project. Asking people to chat with somebody they do not know or have not met can be productive and spark _interest_, but may be a _challenge_ to some. Nevertheless, it can foster information exchange, _trust_, and _collegiality_.

_Topic_ relevance can be achieved by priming participants to contribute something about their domain that other participants do not know, or with physical prompts for discussion - visualization examples or summaries of domain work. Serendipitous conversations can also be effective.

In one of our workshops a WiFi connection problem caused us to halt the workshop methods [P2]. One participant set up a connection through their phone and the organizers' reliance on them had significant effects on _trust_ and _agency_. Other participants discussed the workshop and workshop themes while this was going on - probably with positive effect.
Scheduled downtime works well, but this could easily be faked with some kind of imaginary problem ("_can you just chat amongst yourselves while I fix the WiFi_").
