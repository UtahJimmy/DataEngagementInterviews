summary: Rapidly drawing ideas of increasing complexity helps to prime for sketching and to suspend judgement.
---
A facilitator reads a list of prompts, allowing participants 5 - 10 seconds to draw each idea. The prompts gradually increase in challenge, and include both concrete and abstract ideas. For example, we may ask participants to draw a line, a squiggle, a shape … then turn one of those drawings into a mountain, mode of transportation, a pet, a meal ... Then, turn one of those drawings into a friendly mode of transportation, a helpful pet, a friendly meal…

\\
After a few minutes of drawing, participants can be asked to find three pictures from around the room and create a story to introduce themselves or tell a story.

When facilitated effectively, this is a high-energy method that can engage participants --- garnering _interest_ in the workshop. It encourages _agency_ as participants express themselves through sketching. Importantly, it also prepares participants to think visually, a key part of the _topic_.
