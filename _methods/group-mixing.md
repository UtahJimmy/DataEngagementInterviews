summary: Mix participants in creative ways to support cross-pollination of ideas.
---
This method can be paired with any other method that involves group work. To achieve _collegiality_ we ask participants to work in groups in many of our activities. This can also help us rank ideas as we combine groups that have worked on separate ideas and ask participants to collectively rank their results.

\\
Groups can be mixed in all sorts of ways, but are usually best if they are diverse in terms of seniority, gender, background, skills. We try to mix in multiple ways throughout a session using particular structures --- by organization (vis person vs. domain specialist), but also by personal characteristics. Birthdays are interesting --- grouping by month, season, or day of the week (_"on what day is your birthday this year?"_) etc., helps participants to find things that they have things in common which can help establish _interest_ and _trust_

\\
In terms of the _topic_, there is scope for mixing according to particular graphics that resonate --- perhaps by asking participants to stand near examples from a _Visualization Awareness_ exercise that have been hung on the wall, or according to domain tasks that particular participants think need to be prioritized.

\\
We try to ensure that people are not paired in groups to frequently - mixing groups and even using "_pair up with pople you have not yet grouped with"_ as a grouping activity can be useful, but we should be sensitive to the fact that this may be a _challenge_ for some.
