We have used this divergent, active method early in the workshop core. It is based on creativity methods to generate aspirations that we tailored to visualization by prompting participants with a domain scenario and asking the questions: _``What would you like to know? What would you like to do? What would you like to see?''_

\\
In the process of this method, we first introduce the prompt, and participants answer the know/see/do questions individually on post-it notes. Next, participants share ideas in a large group to encourage _collegiality_ and cross-pollination of ideas. Then, participants form small groups and try to build on their responses by selecting interesting ideas, assuming that they have been completed, and responding to the know/see/do questions again --- increasing the _challenge_. Finally, we lead a convergent discussion to highlight interesting ideas and to transition to the next method.

\\
We encourage participants to record answers to the know/see/do questions on different color post-it notes because each prompt provides information useful at different points in the design process. Participants describe analysis tasks that they would like _to do_ or envisaged insights they would like _to know_. Asking what participants would like _to see_ is often more of a _challenge_, but ensures that a _topic_ of visualization is established early.
