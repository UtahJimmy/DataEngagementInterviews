This method reframes barriers as opportunities to spur creative thinking. First, participants identify barriers of the envisioned visualization tools. Next, they select the most pressing barriers and imagine that it has been removed. Then, they create ideas about what would be possible without that barrier in the way.
\\
\\
We have used this method in four of our workshops [P2, P4, P5, P8]. In our experience, identifying barriers is low _challenge_ and helps to build _interest_ because participants typically have ideas about why problems in their domain are hard. The barriers also provide useful information about the problem space to researchers. Asking participants to remove barriers increases the _challenge_. Because this method is performed in small groups, it can foster _collegiality_.

If this method is preceded by Wishful Thinking, then the know/see/do prompts can be used after barriers are removed.

#### Materials
- at least 2 colors of post-it notes to record the barriers and opportunities
- if preceded by Wishful Thinking, then 1 color post-it notes for barriers + 3 colors for know/see/do prompts
