- After another round of individual written reflection, wrote a [draft (pdf)] in which we tried to present concepts about workshops but without explicit recommendations for future workshops because we were not sure that the recommendations helped with our workshop analysis.
- [Rewrote the draft (pdf)] based on feedback from colleagues who were using workshops in their own visualization research projects. Decided that the framework was starting to become understandable and actionable.
