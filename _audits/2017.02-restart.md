| Slide summarizing an early version of the framework. It identified stages of the process model by their input, output, and motivation. We revised this framework many times. In one change, we realized _scoping_ and _planning_ are mutually influential and completed with an iterative process. We merged them into a single stage in the final framework: _Before the Workshop: Define & Design_. |
