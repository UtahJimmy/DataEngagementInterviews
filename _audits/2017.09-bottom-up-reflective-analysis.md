- Analyzed [workshop methods (xlsx)] with the lens of existing theory, considering frameworks for the analysis of creativity methods and educational workshops.
- Used observation listing to collaboratively list 80+ [observations (xlsx)] about the process and design of workshops.
  - Connected each observation to our collective experience or the theory of creativity, workshops, or visualization.
  - We tried to rank the observations, to group them by topic, and to map them to the workshop process.
- Applied methods from design --- observations-to-insights and insight sorting --- to generate a list of [actionable insights (pdf)].
- Assisted planning and facilitating DiscoveryJam again.

| ![summary](../assets/documents/2017.09-methods-summary.png) |
| We tried to analyze methods in a number of ways. Here, we categorized workshop methods according to a framework for educational workshops. Although we decided that this framework was not directly applicable to visualization creativity workshops, we include it to show one of the many alternatives that we considered. |

| Some ideas that do appear in our final framework are shown in this early _matrix of effects_ in which we tried to characterize methods by their impact on the workshop ideaspace. After further thinking, some of these characteristics were integrated into the _tactics for workshop success_. |

| Early versions of our actionable insights were supported by recommendations (likely beneficial courses of actions) and considerations (things to think about). Here, propose an insight and connect it to our experiences and the creativity literature. Some of the ideas contained in this insight appear in our final framework. |
