- Created a draft of the framework, summarized below, based on the aforementioned Ph.D. proposal. Key notes about this draft:
  - It referred to the use of _critically reflective practice_, but did not yet have a way to concisely base on ideas on our experience and established theory.
  - It tried to precisely characterize different workshop types based on how they are used in the visualization design process.
  - It did not yet capture the mutually influential decisions and iterative nature of design decisions that occur before, during, and after the workshop.
- Reflecting on this paper, we discovered its ideas were not necessarily supported by our experience or the data. This inspired the use of more formal analysis methods.

| A graphical summary of an early draft of the framework. Many of the concepts identified here also appear in our final framework. We decided that the six stage process model, however, was too restrictive and did not accurately reflect our experience. |

| A table describing different types of workshops based on how they connected to the nested model for visualization design, the design activity framework, and the design study methodology. We ultimately abandoned this type of analysis because it was too restrictive and confused rather than clarified. |
