- Critically examined all the ideas in the paper in a full day meeting. Decided to add actionable guidelines back to the framework as a way to organize ideas and to make the results of our analysis more actionable for future researchers.
- Created this website to present key ideas of our reflective analysis and to capture ideas for future workshops that could not make it into our paper, mainly, the example workshop methods.
- Prepared the paper for submission.
