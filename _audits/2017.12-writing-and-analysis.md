- Updated [paper draft (pdf)] based on ideas in the previous collaborative reflection document. Wrestled with separating the _process_ from the method, the workshop _structure_.
- Tried different ways of structuring the concepts about workshop methods:     
  - Applied [bottom-up analysis (pdf)], defining the important aspects of methods using constructs from creativity and design literature. But, this oversimplified workshop methods and was not actionable.
  - Tried [top-down analysis (pdf)], describing the workshop opening, core, and closing. We iteratively improved ideas from this document and some of them appear in our final framework.
  - Also considered workshop methods as [creativity support tools (pdf)] and applied guidelines for creativity support software to method design. Many ideas from this draft also appear in our final framework in the form of _tactics for successful workshops_.
- Assembled an early version of this audit trail from documents produced throughout our reflective analysis. Revisited this audit trails many times in the subsequent months of analysis and writing.

| Two early diagrams of the workshop process and structure. In the process (left), we tried to show that parts of the process are iterative --- as shown by the two-way connections between _initialization_ and _design_. These would later become _Before: define and design_. In the structure (right), we have identified the opening, core, and closing but have not yet figured out how to effectively represent it. Here, it looks like an exploding styrofoam takeout container. |

| We also wrestled with how to summarize our workshop experience as shown in these two tables. Here, we tried to display _all_ of our workshop experience, including workshops that were used as part of a series, although we focused our analysis on the initial workshops. A condensed version of these tables appears in our final framework. We decided to condense the content to make clear that our framework was created for workshops that are used early in the design process or as the first in a series. |
