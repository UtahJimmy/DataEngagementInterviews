 | Screenshot of the proposed research methods. We wrestled with questions about how to create knowledge from collective experience. Here, we describe our process as _collective reflection_ because we have not yet discovered the methodology of critically reflective practice. We have also not yet focused our work on _visualization_ creativity workshops. Hence, we cite 12 projects that we winnowed to 10 in the final paper. |
