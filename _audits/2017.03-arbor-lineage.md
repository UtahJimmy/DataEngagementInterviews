- EK and MM assisted in designing and facilitating two workshops:
  - A workshop to understand analysis needs of genealogists [P7].
  - A workshop to find funded collaboration with phylogenetic analysts [P8].
- We iteratively improved the framework by reflecting on our experience with these two workshops.
