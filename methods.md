# Workshop Methods

We provide a list of methods that we have used in workshops or that we would like to use in future workshops. This list is not exhaustive, definitive, or consistent. It should be seen as a starting point for workshop design.

\\
We organize the following methods according to where they fit in the workshop structure (opening, core, closing), their impact on the ideaspace (divergent, convergent, interpersonal), and their level of activity (active, passive). However, we recognize that any organization of methods is imperfect because visualization research is a messy and iterative process.

\\
For each method, we describe its process and how it relates to the _TACTICS for Workshop Success_: _topic_, _agency_, _challenge_, _trust_, _interest_, and _collegiality_. We also provide a list of materials needed for each method and references that describe the method in more detail.
