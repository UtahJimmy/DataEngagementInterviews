# About
This website contains the Supplemental Material for the paper: _A Framework for Creative Visualization-Opportunities Workshops_ by E. Kerzner, S. Goodwin, J. Dykes, S. Jones, and M. Meyer, submitted to _IEEE InfoVis 2018._

\\
It includes an [audit trail] of significant outputs from our reflective analysis; a set of [example methods] for future workshops; an [example workshop] that we have used successfully in 3 previous projects; and a list of [pitfalls] to avoid in future workshops. Throughout these materials, we refer to our experience --- projects and workshops --- using the same identifies as in the paper [P1 - P8].
