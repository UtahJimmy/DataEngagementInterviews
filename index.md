# About
This website is the supplemental material for the paper [_A Framework for Creative Visualization-Opportunities Workshops_] by E. Kerzner, S. Goodwin, J. Dykes, S. Jones, and M. Meyer. The paper will appear in _IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (InfoVis '18)._ This is also the companion website for the Ph.D. dissertation by E. Kerzner with the same title.

Included in this website are an [audit trail] of significant outputs from reflective analysis of 17 workshops; a set of [example methods] for future workshops; an [example workshop] that we have used successfully in 3 previous projects; and a list of [pitfalls] to avoid in future workshops. Throughout these materials, we refer to our experience --- projects and workshops --- using the same identifies as in the paper and dissertation [P1 - P8].
