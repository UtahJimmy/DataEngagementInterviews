# Example Workshop

We provide an example workshop that can serve as a starting point for the design of future workshops. We have used this sequence of workshop methods in three of our projects [P2, P4, P5]. The methods work in concert, encouraging participants to explore a wide space of visualization opportunities and then to elaborate the more promising ideas.

\\
Here, we present the materials that we used in a workshop with neuroscientists [P4]. We followed this [schedule (pdf)] while using a [slide deck (pdf)] to introduce each method. We also provided handouts for specific methods, such as this [list of examples (pdf)] for visualization analogies.

\\
This is meant to be a starting point for thinking about workshop design. Of course, the methods will need to be tailored for future workshops. And, we strongly encourage the workshop methods and prompts be tested numerous times before execution. We also recommend having alternative methods prepared so that facilitators can adapt the workshop based on participant reactions.
